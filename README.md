## About
Grader is a Russian cities catalog inspired by Nomadlist.com. Main goal is to provide people information about where they can emigrate.

Russia is not a vary pleasant place with its aggressive weather and same sort of people. But sometimes you have no other choice to leave it. This project is an attempt to help those people who are stacked here to find their place to live.

## Technologies
